# SetSizes (WIP)

Krita plugin that provides shortcuts for setting the brush to my favorite sizes (hardcoded for now and subject to change).

# Install

See [Managing Python plugins](https://docs.krita.org/en/user_manual/python_scripting/install_custom_python_plugin.html).

The dev-install script is for me for development on windows but it should also work if you want to clone the repo locally and install/update the plugin (you will still need to enable it the first time). Note it will NOT ask whether to overwrite files.

# Usage

Go to Configure Krita => Keyboard Shortcuts => Search "Set Size" and set to whatever shortcuts you want. Personally I use keys 1 through 0.
