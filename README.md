# Ten Brush Sizes

Krita plugin that provides ten shortcuts for setting ten configurable brush sizes.

# Install

See [Managing Python plugins](https://docs.krita.org/en/user_manual/python_scripting/install_custom_python_plugin.html).

The dev-install script is for me for development, but it should also work if you want to clone the repo locally and install/update the plugin (you will still need to enable it the first time). Note it will NOT ask whether to overwrite files.

# Usage

Go to Settings => Configure Krita => Keyboard Shortcuts => Search "Set Brush Size" and set to whatever shortcuts you want. Personally I use keys 1 through 0.

To configure the sizes, go to Tools => Scripts => Ten Brush Sizes
